IOC has three different ways to work
1: through XML
2: through BeanConfig

This demo show the BeanConfig implementation 


Add these following dependencies into the POM.xml

1: <artifactId>aspectjrt</artifactId>
2: <artifactId>aspectjweaver</artifactId>

keeping all the bean under the spring radar put the annotation "@Componenet"

For the Aspect creation, put the annotation @Aspect make the bean aspect 
e.g Logging, authentication anad authorization and data sanitization

Enable "@EnableAspectJAutoProxy" into the BeanConfig java file

Aspect 
Before Logging:

@Before("execution(* ExampleAop.ShoppingCart.CheckOut(..))")
	here, * shows, the return type
	dot between the (..), shows the input parameter

@Before("execution(* *.*.CheckOut(..))") //any file has checkout method [* for any package second * for any class]



PointCuts:

so for different packages and class we need to defined the pointcuts, 
so when point cut reached specified aspects are execute.  

also "Execution" defined on which particular method we need to execeute the aspect [see file logginAspect]
execution gives answer of when and where aspect will run when = before , where = checkout()
